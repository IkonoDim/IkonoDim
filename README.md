# Hi, I'm Dimi! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a jung developer based in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª with a passion for coding. I have a diverse background, being Greek and German.
I started programming with python in 2020, with my first project being a discord bot. After that I moved on to making my own websites and later also web backend using the popular python library flask. Lately I've been expolring new languages to gather more experience. Right now I've started making my own minecraft plugins for paper.
